### ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY

This basic project had the intention to demonstrate and study the process of Image Classification using pre-trained models.

Under Dr. Bai surpervisory, we would implement this technology on a small propotype of a self-driven car robot.

To understand better the process of image classification, [this link](https://learnopencv.com/pytorch-for-beginners-image-classification-using-pre-trained-models/) was used as a reference.

This project is divided as follows:

```
deepnet
   * __init.py__       : standard initialization python code
   * deepnetclassfy.py : python class that contains the image classification code
```

```
examples
   * images          : images to try out the program
   * testdeepnet.py  : 'main' program (that should be run!)
```

These are the main folders of this project.

To run this project, I used PyCharm environment under python3 --version 3.8.4

The purpose of this project is not to have accurate results. Just, as I said above, to demonstrate and study the process of Image Classification.
